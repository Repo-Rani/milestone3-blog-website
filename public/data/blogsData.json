    "content": ["Is it possible to write something new about a holiday in Italy, or is it such a hackneyed topic that absolutely nothing can surprise you? Today I am going to surprise you and share with you absolutely unknown, incredibly underrated, and therefore wonderful places to travel and visit in Southern Italy. Here you will not encounter crowds of tourists, these places are many hundreds of years old and they live their own lives, in their own reality. Italy is one of the countries that are among the most visited by tourists in the world. Due to its natural, historical, and cultural features, it attracts a huge number of people every year. When it comes to Italian getaways, the allure of cities like Rome, Florence, and Venice often steals the spotlight. However, Southern Italy holds a treasure trove of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. I lived in the south of Italy for several years, most of which were spent living in and around Naples. I will not mention Sorrento, Amalfi, and Positano in this article since they have already received enough attention and you can read a bunch of other articles about them in which everything is written for me. Instead, I will reveal to you new and lesser-known places that have actually received criminally little attention. Today we will fix this and I will try to share with you my sincere impressions of visiting these places! From the bustling streets of Naples to the charming villages along the Amalfitan Coast, this journey takes you off the beaten path to explore the lesser-known, but equally captivating, destinations of this picturesque region.",
  "Naples, the vibrant heart of Southern Italy, is a city that defies expectations at every turn. Steeped in history, it boasts ancient Roman ruins like Pompeii and Herculaneum, where time stands still, allowing you to walk in the footsteps of a bygone era. But Naples is not merely a city frozen in the past; it thrives in the present, pulsating with life, energy, and an unshakable spirit. As once said Johann Wolfgang von Goethe:",
"Historical Marvels: Naples is a living testament to Italys rich history. As you wander through its labyrinthine streets, you will encounter layers of civilization, from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Byzantines and Normans. The historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a treasure trove of historical wonders, with centuries-old churches, palaces, and hidden courtyards waiting to be explored.",
"The People: What truly sets Naples apart is its people. These are not just words. During my travels and experience living in different places, I have not met more helpful and friendly people anywhere else. The most amazing thing is that it will be really important for them to help if you ask for help, they are also very interested in communicating with foreigners, and their energy and positivity are contagious. Known for their warmth and vivacity, Neapolitans have a unique way of making you feel like family from the moment you arrive. Engaging in conversations with locals, you will quickly discover their infectious passion for life, expressed through animated gestures and the charming Neapolitan dialect.",

"Culinary Delights: Naples is often hailed as the birthplace of pizza, and rightly so. Here, you will find the most authentic and mouthwatering pizza in the world. A visit to Naples is incomplete without savoring a classic Margherita or Marinara pizza in its birthplace. But the citys culinary wonders extend beyond pizza; delve into the world of traditional Neapolitan dishes like pasta with rag√π, fried pizza, and the beloved sfogliatella pastry.",

"The Contrasts: Naples is a city of contrasts, where ancient history coexists with modern life. Many people consider the city dirty and mired in corruption and crime, but during my stay here I have not encountered anything that did not happen to me in Rome or Milan. At the same time, there is a completely unique atmosphere here that envelops you and makes you forget about all your worries. You can explore the subterranean mysteries of Napoli Sotterranea, an underground network of tunnels and catacombs, and then ascend to the vibrant neighborhoods of Vomero and Posillipo for panoramic views of the Bay of Naples. This duality is what gives Naples its unique charm.",
"Dont Miss:",

"Spaccanapoli: Wander through the narrow streets of the historic center, where centuries-old buildings line the way, and the aroma of pizza fills the air.",

"Naples National Archaeological Museum: Immerse yourself in the rich history of the region, with artifacts from Pompeii and Herculaneum.",

"San Carlo Opera House (Teatro di San Carlo): Its one of the oldest opera houses in the world, known for its stunning architecture and world-class performances.",

"Piazza del Plebiscito: This large square is home to several important landmarks, including the Royal Palace of Naples and the Church of San Francesco di Paola. Its a great place to relax and people-watch.",

"Naples Historic Center (Centro Storico): Wander through the historic heart of Naples, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Visit San Gregorio Armeno Street, famous for its nativity figurines, and explore the narrow alleys filled with shops, churches, and bustling pizzerias.",

    "content":["Nothing comes similar to trekking in Nepal‚Äîmajestic mountains, hidden trails, and landscapes have an effect that leaves one breathless. Rich in mesmerizing landscapes along with a variety of vibrant cultures and incomparable natural beauty, Nepal offers travelers what has long been called a trekkers' paradise. Whether you're a seasoned hiker who's up for a good challenging hike or just a beginner looking to get out and enjoy nature, Nepal has treks suitable for all levels of experience.",

"Starting from the world-renowned Annapurna Circuit and Everest Base Camp treks to the untrodden Langtang Valley and Upper Mustang treks, this place has everything. You will be in the pleasant environment of the Himalayas while moving between beautiful valleys, dense forests, and old mountain villages. Enjoy broad views of snow peaks, magnificent glaciers, and endless falls, plunging down like it would leave one spellbound.",

"But trekking in Nepal is not just about the sceneries; it is also about the warm and hospitable Nepalese people, their culture, and delicious food. So enough of that lace-up talk; get the backpack ready and set off for unlimited experiences in the land of high mountains, Nepal.",

"Top trekking destinations out of many in Nepal.",
"Nepal offers the traveler his dream destination. It is a set of different kinds of destinations that should compliment people with any level of hiking experience: from its iconic Everest Base Camp to the serene Langtang Valley, every trek in Nepal promises an unforgettable adventure.",

"Annapurna Circuit is one of the most reputed trekking routes of Nepal in the world that gives one not just a challenging trek but also the bounties of walking in Nepalese Himalayan trails. This trail gives panoramic views of the snow-capped peaks, lush forest, and the traditional settlement of the Himalaya. On your ascent through Thorong La Pass, the sights inspire the heart-stopping panoramic vistas of the Annapurna massif and the Tibetan Plateau.",

"The Everest Base Camp trek really needs no introduction. This is an iconic trip that lands you to the world's highest mountain‚ÄîMount Everest. You will be treated to the picturesque views of Khumbu Glacier, Khumbu Icefall, and, of course, Everest‚Äîthe majestic peak that's above all. It gives you a sense of achievement, a feel of being under the topmost peak in the world.",

"Permits and regulations for trekking in Nepal",
"A trek in Nepal must be systematically prepared with due consideration to the essential permits and regulations. Before embarking on a trek, you should get acquainted with all required documentation and those rules.",

"The Nepal Tourism Board looks after the entire trekking industry in the country, and they mandate that all trekkers get themselves a Trekkers Information Management System card, which is a permit that allows you to trek or hike on different mountains in the country. Likewise, if your trekking route falls under a conserved area, under either the Annapurna Conservation Area or the Sagarmatha National Park, you will definitely require a separate permit for trekking in that particular area.",

"You will discover that permit requirements vary depending primarily on the trekking destination and the exact route that is intended. Some places, for example, the restricted area of Upper Mustang, demand additional kinds of permits. It's good to consult with a well-established trekking agency or the NTB to clear up all the doubts in time and have all the necessary permits and papers done before the journey.",

"Necessary trekking gear and equipment",
"Preparation of proper trekking equipment and related gear is a key to making a successful and comfortable trek in Nepal. From comfortable hiking boots to warm clothing layers, each item is important for ensuring safety as well as well-being.",

"Now, among the equipment, a good sturdy pair of hiking boots is without doubt one of the most essential. They should be designed to provide good support, great traction, and adequate protection to your feet over such a rough track. Well before such treks, it is advisable to break-in your boots, in that the question of blisters and being uncomfortable will be kept at bay.",

"Layering is key in the clothing for trekking in Nepal. You are going to need a base layer wearing the moisture-wicking fabrics, another one for insulation, and then an outer layer for protection against the conditions of the environment. You will need warm, waterproof jackets, pants, and gloves, especially in the higher regions where temperatures tend to plunge.",

"Apart from that, some essential considerations during trekking are good quality and sturdy backpack with enough supporting strap, water filtration system, sleeping bag including its liner to offer insulation enough to take expected night-time temperatures, headlamp or flashlight and a first-aid kit. You can also take account of trekking poles, which will reduce the strain on your knees, provide you stability, and let you push on harder sections of the trail.",


"Physical fitness and preparation for trekking in Nepal",
"Trekking in Nepal requires a fair measure of physical well-being and preparedness to ensure that the accomplishment goes through safely but more enjoyably. Even for the seasoned trekkers, access to the points of trekking is difficult due to high altitudes, significant inclines, and long-distance hiking.",

"Before travelling for trekking, it is essential to evaluate the fitness condition and adopt targeted fitness exercises into a regular routine. This might involve activities such as running, cycling, or swimming, which can be heart-moving and aerobic, together with exercises involving strength training, which can help you tone and increase general muscle strength.",

"It will also be helpful to simulate some of the demands of trekking in Nepal by including hikes into your training routine with a weighted backpack. This will help your body get physically set and also help you test your gear and packing list.",

"This is a very important point to keep in mind, not to forget the aspect of altitude sickness while trekking in Nepal. To minimize the threat it is advised to acclimatize gradually at the higher altitudes, take rest days en route, gradually move high if trekking in extended routes so that the body gets used to acclimatize correctly. Staying properly hydrated, eating balanced food, and resting will be helpful in maintaining your health and physical condition properly.",

"Trekking routes and difficulty levels",
"In Nepal, a wide range of trekking routes offers diversified options that meet high challenges with great rewards. It does not matter if you are a developing hiker or beginner explorer; there is the experience of trekking that compliments your preference and skill level.",

"The trek to Everest Base Camp is of course among the most popular ones in Nepal. This classic journey follows in the footsteps of Hillary and Tenzing and goes right into the very heart of the Khumbu. The duration of the trek normally lasts from 12 to 16 days, and in order to do the trek, one should be in good physical condition and have plenty of stamina.",

"The other type of trek is a classical trek, the Annapurna Circuit. The trek takes 17-21 days in the Annapurna mountain range, whereas it even involves crossing the Thorong La pass with an elevation of over 5, 416 meters; it is still regarded as more moderate in challenge as compared to the Everest Base Camp.",

"For those seeking a less challenging but equally fulfilling experience, the Langtang Valley trek is the right one. It's an experience lasting from 7 to 10 days, which allows trekking through Langtang National Park. Here one can get breathtaking views of Langtang Lirung and Gangchempo peaks, plus exploring traditional Tibetan-influenced villages.",

"Teahouse trekking vs. camping trekking in Nepal",
"This is the time when you have to make your decision for the great Nepali Himalayas‚Äîeither trekking in a teahouse or camping.",

"For them, the best part of the teahouse trekking is that it is popular and easiest. There will be a network of teahouses along the well-trodden trekking routes that serve basic accommodation, meals, and amenities. Particular, after the teahouses started to cater for the accommodation, meals, and additional amenities, one is left to most likely enter into the comfort zone both socially and psychologically, for teahouse trekking makes it possible for one to have an interface with other trekkers and get involved on a close basis with the local culture.",

"Conversely, camping trekking is a bit more remote and has an adventurous flavor. This means those going for a camping trek will have to carry all the camping equipment for the night, including the tent, a sleeping bag, and cooking gear, and have a camp set up in the designated camping sites along the trail. Trekking with camping is primitively tough, for you are self-supporting, and certainly, the loads have to be bulkier, but it also means traveling away from the often-trodden trekking routes of Nepal and exploring secluded and virgin terrains.",

"The decision for you should be either teahouse trekking or camping trekking, considering one's preference, fitness level, the particular route that thrills you for trekking, and your goals and comfort level.",

"Safety measures while trekking and emergency procedures",
"Trekkers are passing by the side as the local women are going to collect the timber wood with the baskets on the back.",
"Trekking in Nepal is very rewarding, but it is also related to some risks that have to be taken very cautiously and watchfully. One of the top priorities in the course of your trekking shall have to be the safety in the activity.",

"One of the most major worrying issues while high up involves the presence of altitude sickness at elevations higher than 2,500 m. Mild symptoms may include one having a headache and some nausea, but severe conditions such as high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema could be life-threatening. To avert these, it is paramount that one acclimatizes gradually by ascending at a safe rate about the elevation gained each day, keeping one's self hydrated, and carefully observing for any sign and symptoms of altitude sickness.",

"In the case of an accident, a trekker has to carry a good first aid kit and must know basic first aid which includes the treatment of simple injuries, identification of mountain sickness, and, in the worst cases, even rescue initiation procedures. You are also advised to a very high extent to trek with a group or hire a local guide who will be of great aid and support for you at the time of any emergency or crisis.",

"Besides, get to know the emergency instructions and the mode of communication in an emergency, be it accident or natural calamity. This includes where, when, and how to alert the local authorities, emergency services, or trekking agency for help.",

"Cultural experiences and highlights during trekking in Nepal",
"Trekking in Nepal is not limited to the climbing up of majestic mountains; rather, it also involves indulging oneself in the rich cultural tapestry of the region. From colorful prayer flags blowing in the wind to warm hospitality, every step you will take while trekking is more than a view into the unique traditions and ways of life that exist here in the Himalayas.",

"While trekking in Nepal, a visit to the typical Tibetan-influenced village will be of lots of interest to observe the daily routines of the locals, their customary practices, and their belief system. Wander around ancient monasteries, then maybe cast an enquiring eye over the subtle rites of the Buddhists, sipping a smoking bowl of Thukpa and munching on momos after the walk.",

"En route you will pass many colorful festivities and celebrations which reflect the Himalayan people's deep-rooted spirituality. Such experiences will surely be colorful-be it with the vibrant Holi festival or the palette of the Lhosar New Year.",

"Getting to meet local communities, which are friendly and welcoming, is also another reward in trekking in Nepal. Stop, and waste some time talking with some porters and guides, get some tea at local homes in the villages, and you will have plenty of rewards from the insights into their lifestyle, tradition, world perspectives, and many more.",

"Final tips for a memorable trekking experience in Nepal",
"For trekking to Nepal, it is not about the destination but the experiences and the bond you share with others. With its scenic beauty, cultural heritage, and hospitality, trekking in Nepal is absolutely remarkable, touching hearts, etching in your mind forever.",

"Here are few things to consider to make your trek memorable and a success",

"Do your trek planning well in advance, considering the best season and your fitness level to explore that particular route.",

"Invest in the best quality of trekking gear and equipment so that your comfort and safety are guaranteed on the trail.",

"Expect the unexpected, and be flexible with the itinerary if there are changes in weather and terrain.",

"Respect the local culture and customs. Talk to the communities that you meet to understand life‚Äîthe Himalayan way.",

"Be hydrated, rested, and balanced to keep safe away from issues such as altitude sickness and others.",

"Hire local guides, and be part of trekking groups for that roll-in feel of the greatness of local content.",

"Armed with these invaluable tips, head off for a very memorable, thrilling experience of adventure trekking in the land of the Himalayas‚Äîin the country of Nepal. Lace your boots, pack your baggage, and get ready to immerse yourself in a world of natural beauty, cultural wealth, and finally, loads of unforgettable memories.",

  "Ravello: A Hidden Gem in the Hills",

"For me personally, this is an absolutely unique place, which is my personal favorite of all the others that I will mention in this article. I cant express in my own words the emotions I feel when I get there again and again; its just a magical experience. Nestled high above the Tyrrhenian Sea, Ravello is a picturesque and serene village that often escapes the bustling tourist radar of the Amalfi Coast. This hidden place, with its captivating beauty and peaceful ambiance, offers a unique and enchanting experience for those who seek a quieter slice of paradise. Perched on a clifftop, the village provides a vantage point that allows you to gaze upon the dramatic coastline and the azure sea below. The vistas are nothing short of mesmerizing, and they create a sense of serenity and wonder that is unmatched. I would like to quote Richard Wagner:",

"‚ÄúThe enchanting nature of this region, the radiant sky, the colors, the flowers, and the splendid scenery make it the closest approximation to paradise.‚Äù",


"This place is ideal for traveling artists looking for inspiration ‚Äî heaven on earth awaits you here.",

"Villa Cimbrone and Villa Rufolo: Explore the enchanting gardens and terraces of these historic villas, offering panoramic views of the coastline",

"Ravello Festival: If you visit in the summer, enjoy classical concerts and cultural events in unique settings.",



"Maiori and Minori: Seaside Serenity",

"Nestled along the breathtaking Amalfi Coast, the charming villages of Maiori and Minori offer a more tranquil and authentic Italian experience compared to their bustling neighbors. While Amalfi, Positano, and Ravello often steal the limelight, these two coastal towns have their unique allure thats well worth exploring. Maiori boasts one of the largest and most inviting beaches on the Amalfi Coast. With its expansive shoreline, its the perfect destination for sun-seekers and water enthusiasts. The towns laid-back atmosphere makes it an ideal spot to unwind and enjoy the Mediterranean sun. Just a stones throw away from Maiori lies Minori, a quaint village celebrated for its culinary delights. Often referred to as the ‚ÄúCity of Taste,‚Äù Minori boasts a rich gastronomic tradition that dates back centuries.",



"Maioris Lungomare: Stroll along the seaside promenade and relax on the sandy beach.",

"Minoris Lemon Groves: Discover the towns renowned lemon gardens and indulge in lemon-themed treats.",

"Vietri sul Mare: The Gateway to Amalfi",

"Often overshadowed by its more famous neighbors, Vietri sul Mare is a vibrant and picturesque coastal town that welcomes travelers with its colorful facades, artisanal ceramics, and undeniable charm. Often regarded as the first town of the Amalfi Coast, Vietri offers a unique blend of history, artistry, and coastal beauty. The town is home to several architectural treasures, including the Church of San Giovanni Battista, which features a beautiful dome adorned with ceramic tiles. Explore the charming streets and alleyways to discover hidden chapels, historic buildings, and colorful facades that contribute to Vietri sul Mares distinctive character.",


"Atranis Charming Square: Enjoy a quiet evening in this picturesque village square.",

"While many visitors are inevitably drawn to the Amalfi Coast for its unparalleled coastal vistas, only a select few venture off the beaten path to explore the lesser-known hiking trails that promise a different, equally enchanting perspective of this breathtaking region. Here, amidst the rugged cliffs and lush greenery, you will find a world waiting to be discovered.",

"Path of the Gods: Aptly named the ‚ÄúPath of the Gods‚Äù (Sentiero degli Dei) is a hiking trail that lives up to its celestial title. Its an excursion that unveils the coasts natural wonders in a way that words alone cannot capture. As you follow this ancient path you will traverse rocky terrain and meander through fragrant lemon groves. Along the way, your senses will be treated to the scents of wildflowers and the symphony of chirping birds. And then at a certain point along the trail, it happens ‚Äî your breath will be taken away by the panoramic views of the azure Tyrrhenian Sea below with the rugged cliffs of the Amalfi Coast on one side and the rolling hills on the other. This is a hike that transcends the physical; its a journey of the soul.",

"Valle delle Ferriere: The ‚ÄúValley of Ironworks‚Äù (Valle delle Ferriere) is another hidden gem. As you wander deeper into the valley, away from the coastal crowds, you will encounter a lush, almost primordial world. Verdant ferns and moss-covered rocks create a mystical atmosphere, reminiscent of a fairy tale. The trail leads to a cascade of waterfalls, where the crystalline waters cascade over ancient ironworks, adding a touch of history to this natural wonder. Its a serene escape that feels worlds away from the bustling coastal towns."],

What is mindfulness? What is meditation?", "By finding answers to these questions we will realize that mindfulness training is essential for successful meditation, and meditation is the best method by which we can fulfill our wish to be happy and find meaning in our life. With this understanding, our training in mindfulness exercises will bring lasting happiness to ourself and others.", "'The real source of happiness is inner peace. If our mind is peaceful, we will be happy all the time, regardless of external conditions, but if it is disturbed or troubled in any way, we will never be happy, no matter how good our external conditions may be. External conditions can only make us happy if our mind is peaceful. We can understand this through our own experience. For instance, even if we are in the most beautiful surroundings and have everything we need, the moment we get angry any happiness we may have disappears. This is because anger has destroyed our inner peace.", "We can see from this that if we want true, lasting happiness we need to develop and maintain a special experience of inner peace. The only way to do this is to train our mind through spiritual practice gradually reducing and eliminating our negative, disturbed states of mind and replacing them with positive, peaceful states. Eventually, through continuing to improve our inner peace we will experience supreme permanent peace of mind, or nirvana. Once we have attained nirvana we will be happy throughout our life, and in life after life. We will have solved all our problems and accomplished the true meaning of our human life", "Mindfulness works together with alertness, which is that part of our mind that checks to see if we are still holding the object of mindfulness. Meditation practice also depends on concentration, a single-pointed mind that induces inner peace through focusing on the meditation object. Mindfulness is essential for successful meditation, and as Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso says, is the life of concentration", "I will cherish all living beings without exception because this precious mind of love is the supreme method for solving all problems and fulfilling all wishes. Eventually it will give me the supreme happiness of enlightenment", "Mindfulness is not something that we practise only during the meditation session. We need to bring our positive experiences during meditation into our daily experiences, which we do by not forgetting and being mindful of the meditation object during the meditation break, our daily life."],

Create a comfortable environment: For most people, a cool, dark, and quiet room is ideal for sleeping. If this does not describe your bedroom, consider using blackout curtains, a noise machine, or earplugs. If you can not control the room temperature, a fan can help cool things off while also offering some ambient noise."],

Whether you make a point to eat more fruits and vegetables or get outside for a daily walk, there is not just one way to maintain a healthy lifestyle. To center health and wellness in your life, try including some or all of the 12 tips we include in this article. Adopting just a few of these recommendations can go a long way to improving your physical and mental well-being.", "Maintain a healthy weight for you", "Keeping your weight in a healthy range can protect you from things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.", "Add variety to your meals. Eat a variety of foods that includes fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Aim to eat at least 5 servings (400 grams) of fruits and vegetables every day, especially fresh, seasonal ones. If you are not vegetarian, include fatty fish in your diet, since omega-3 fatty acids can help prevent inflammatory diseases such as heart diseases. Cut back on salt. Your daily salt consumption should not exceed 1 gram (or 1 teaspoon). Add less salt when preparing your meal, limit the amount of high-sodium condiments like soy sauce you add to your foods, and avoid salty snacks. Reducing the amount of sodium in your diet decreases your risk for high blood pressure. Limit your sugar intake. Limit your sugar intake to 50 grams or about 12 teaspoons a day. You can achieve this by avoiding snacks, candies, and sweetened drinks, such as fruit juices and sodas. Reducing your sugar intake reduces your likelihood of developing diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. Avoid unhealthy fats. Fats should only make up 30% of your total energy intake. Stick to unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, fish, nuts, seeds, and avocados. Avoid saturated fats, such as red meat, butter, and cheese, as well as trans fats, such as baked foods and prepackaged, ready-to-eat items.", "2. Stay well hydrated", "Remember to drink 8 glasses of water a day. Your body is made up of 80% water, and water is necessary for regular bowel function, optimal muscle performance, and immune and skin health. Not drinking enough water can cause dehydration, fatigue, headache, dry skin, and weakened immunity.", "3. Exercise regularly", "Try to get at least 150 minutes of exercises a week or 30 minutes of exercise at least 5 days a week. Whether its walking, jogging, swimming, or doing an at-home Pilates workout, the goal is to stay physically active. Exercise not only helps you maintain a healthy weight, but also decreases your risk of developing diseases as a result of a sedentary lifestyle.", "4. Get enough good sleep", "There is a strong link between sleep and the immune system. Getting seven to nine hours of sleep heals and strengthens your body while you are asleep. Good sleep is vital for your physical and mental health.", "5. Limit your alcohol intake", "Drinking alcohol in excess can lead to liver diseases and even liver cancer in the long run. Alcohol abuse can also cause impaired judgment and even lead to accidents and injuries.Men should limit alcoholic drinks to 2 a day, while women should limit alcohol drinks to 1 drink a day. ", "6. Do not smoke", "Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer across the globe. Apart from lung cancer, smoking contributes to the development of other organ cancers as well. It also increases your risk for heart disease. In addition to being harmful to your own health, smoking is also harmful to the people around you. Secondhand smoking damages the airways and the lungs and is also a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"],

    "content": ["The Science Behind Emotional Intelligence", "Emotions are not just a matter of the heart. Recent advances in research have shown that they are also a result of brain biochemistry. These conclusions come from neuroscience, evolution, medicine, psychology, and management. Emotional signals in the brain are felt throughout the body‚Äîin the gut, in the heart, in the head, in the neck, and so on. These sensations are important signals: if we learn to read them, they will help us make decisions and initiate action.", "Most scientists believe that the control center of emotions in the brain is the limbic system, consisting of the amygdala, the hippocampus, and other structures in the mid-brain. The limbic system stores every experience we have from the first moments of life: impressions are stored in these areas long before we acquire the verbal or higher thinking abilities to put them into words. It is this vast warehouse of feelings and impressions that provides a context or meaning for those memories.", "Messages are transmitted to the brain by neurons, traveling through an electrical transmission system. In the 1970s, however, scientists discovered that our bodies also contain a chemical system for transmitting messages. This system is based on chemicals called peptides, which have receptors in every cell of our bodies. These highly sensitive information substances are thought to be the chemical substrates of emotion, triggering impression memories throughout our lives. Our brains are linked to all our body systems, and it is these peptides that are responsible for the emotions we ‚Äúfeel‚Äù in various parts of our bodies.", "This chemical transmission system just described is far, far older in evolutionary history than the electrical brain. In fact, many of the same information substances found in humans are found in one-celled animals. Their presence in the most basic as well as the most complex forms of life is a clear indication of their importance.", "Evolution of the Brain: Three Functional Layers Very, very early in evolutionary history, simple ‚Äúbeings‚Äù had brainstems that regulated autonomic function and kept them alive. Human beings still have a brainstem, located just above the spinal cord, which tells our lungs to breathe and our hearts to beat. Similar in architecture to the brainstem of reptiles, the human brainstem is sometimes called the reflex brain or the first brain. We can summon it to conscious awareness, although it usually functions automatically. The limbic system or emotional brain is thought to have developed out of the first brain. It helps us store and remember past experiences and learn from them. The limbic system in humans is located in the approximate center of the brain; when information enters the limbic system, we experience bodily sensations, transmitted by the peptides or chemical information substances, in the form of a ‚Äúreaction‚Äù to the stimulus with much more awareness of what is happening than at the level of the first brain.", "Out of this limbic system came the rational (thinking) brain or thin cortex. The cortex enables us to comprehend sensory information and plan accordingly. The very thin outermost layer of the cortex called the neocortex is responsible for higher order thinking and symbolic communication, art and ideas, and long-term planning. The millions or billions of connections between the limbic brain and the thinking brain allow for the free-flow of information between these layers. What the Three Brain Layers Do", "The first brain (brain stem) is the seat of autonomic or automatic response, as well as the seat of habits. It connects us to our external world through our skin, our pores, and our nerves. It controls what impulses get recognized and passed along to the two higher levels. This brain learns through imitation, avoidance, and repetition until something becomes habitual. Information usually enters at this point without our conscious awareness. We can make much of this information conscious and use it to our benefit, as biofeedback and hypnosis have shown us. The emotional brain (limbic system) helps us know what things to approach and what to avoid by guiding our preferences. As we move through life and have more experiences, we have stronger intuitions, hunches, and gut reactions because more things are stored in the limbic warehouse. We have ‚Äúlearned‚Äù from experience. Intuition is emotional learning gained over many years; a 14 year old has little intuition because he or she has not experienced enough life to make connections between experiences. As we mature, we accumulate more reliable emotional data that can offer us valuable clues and guide our behavior, providing we become aware of its existence and learn how to interpret it. Unfortunately, many adults have been taught to ignore this type of information.", "The rational brain (neocortex) assists us with functions related to thinking and language: planning, questioning, making decisions, solving problems, and generating new ideas. This layer is connected to the emotional brain with millions of connections, allowing the emotional and the thinking brains to influence one another in a myriad of ways and providing rich data on which to draw conclusions and initiate action."],

Emotional intelligence is typically divided into four core components: Self-awareness: The ability to recognise and understand one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and their impact on behaviour and decision-making.Self-management: The skill to regulate and control one's emotions, especially in high-stress situations, and to adapt to changing circumstances.Social awareness: The capacity to empathise with others, recognise their emotions, and understand their perspectives.elationship management: The ability to build and maintain positive relationships, communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, and inspire others.", "In any professional setting, communication is a cornerstone of success. Individuals with high emotional intelligence are not only better at expressing themselves, but they are also skilled at active listening, which is essential for understanding the needs, concerns, and perspectives of colleagues and clients. They can navigate challenging conversations with empathy and diplomacy, fostering stronger, more productive working relationships.Leadership and Team Dynamics: In leadership roles, EQ is often more critical than IQ. Effective leaders need to inspire and motivate their teams, make tough decisions, and maintain a positive work environment. Leaders with high emotional intelligence are better equipped to manage the complexities of human interactions, leading to more engaged and productive teams. Conflict Resolution and Negotiation: Conflicts are an inevitable part of any workplace. Individuals with high EQ can address conflicts with empathy and objectivity, seeking mutually beneficial solutions. They are skilled negotiators who can find common ground and resolve disputes more effectively, ultimately enhancing team cohesion.", "While IQ contributes to analytical and critical thinking, EQ plays a pivotal role in decision-making and problem-solving. Emotional intelligence helps individuals assess situations holistically, taking into account the emotional and interpersonal factors that often influence choices. It aids in making well-informed, balanced decisions. Stress Management: The workplace can be a stressful environment, but high EQ individuals are adept at managing their own stress and helping others cope. They remain composed under pressure, which is invaluable for decision-making, team leadership, and overall well-being. Client and Customer Relations: In customer-facing roles, emotional intelligence is a crucial asset. The ability to understand the needs and emotions of clients or customers, and respond appropriately, can lead to increased satisfaction, loyalty, and business success. Personal and Professional Growth: Individuals with high EQ are often more self-driven and open to personal and professional growth. They seek feedback, learn from their experiences, and continuously strive for self-improvement.", "In conclusion, emotional intelligence is not a soft skill to be overlooked but a vital attribute that can significantly impact one's success in the workplace. While IQ may open doors, it is EQ that enables individuals to thrive and excel in their careers. To build a truly successful and satisfying professional life, cultivating and nurturing emotional intelligence is paramount. In the ever-evolving landscape of the modern workplace, it's clear that EQ matters more than IQ."],

Enroll in your companys retirement plan (if you havent already) Does your employer offer a retirement plan, like a 401(k)? Sign up if you can. This is a great way to automate your savings and its not as difficult as you think. Your company may also offer matching dollars. Take advantage of this free money. For instance, if your employer offers a five-percent match, it means they will contribute the same amount to your account that you do, up to five percent of your salary. (You may be able to contribute more, of course, but only the first five percent will be matched. In other words, your employer is offering you extra money. Think of it as additional salary.

Why are some people motivated to participate productively in their community and more likely to persevere in the face of setbacks? To unlock this puzzle, it is helpful to understand the underlying mechanisms in the brain that develop in childhood and build the foundation for later complex behavior.", "There are two main types of motivation: approach motivation, which involves the release of a neurochemical that tells us something is about to happen that we should enjoy; and avoidance motivation, which directs us away from a threatening or unpleasant response by releasing hormones that trigger a ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response. Both approach and avoidance motivation develop in childhood and are influenced by intrinsic (internal) drivers and extrinsic (external) feedback.", "Once their basic needs are met, most young children are motivated intrinsically by exploration, active involvement in play, and achieving mastery or success in a task. This kind of approach motivation is important for learning and development because it leads to intense engagement in a task and eventual mastery, which is associated with pride and satisfaction. Intrinsic drivers are considered to be the strongest and most lasting motivators, especially in early childhood, but positive feedback can support and reinforce the inherent feelings of satisfaction or pleasure.", "2. The desire to have a rewarding experience can be more powerful than the pleasure of the reward that is actually experienced.", "‚ÄúWanting‚Äù refers to the intense desire for experiencing pleasure. The circuits responsible for wanting connect the emotions that were felt with the reward itself‚Äîand the actions that led to it‚Äîso strongly that, even when the reward is less or not received at all, the brain will still prompt us to repeat the action that initially led to it. This separation explains why some people engage in once-rewarding behaviors past the point where they are enjoyable, like eating too much dessert or drinking too much alcohol.", "‚ÄúLiking‚Äù refers to the actual sensation of pleasure. The circuits involved are much more fragile and difficult to activate, which may be one reason why intense pleasure is harder to experience than intense desire. For example, the smell of a bakery may trigger ‚Äúwanting‚Äù based on past memories linking sweets to pleasure, but the actual experience of eating too many sweets may not be nearly as pleasurable in reality.", "Experiences at different stages of childhood may have different kinds of impacts on the developing motivation systems.", "Infants learn best through interactions with parents and other adult caregivers who establish responsive, supportive relationships with them. First, babies learn simple preferences among pleasant and unpleasant experiences. Then, they begin to distinguish between threats that truly need to be avoided and those that are less dangerous‚Äîhere, the supportive presence of a trusted adult can have a buffering effect. For example, a loud noise may startle young children, but if they are in the presence of someone they are attached to and feel secure with, and who responds supportively, they will be less likely to experience high levels of stress.", "During adolescence, the motivation system is increasingly influenced by peers, exploration, and performance feedback. The pleasure of social acceptance is present early in life and remains important in adulthood, but is especially powerful in adolescence when the brain is particularly tuned into these rewards. This increased sensitivity to social rewards can lead to an inclination toward risk-taking and self-oriented acts, but also powers exploratory learning and the ability to adapt to different social contexts and cultures.", "The brains motivation systems can be disrupted by a lack of responsive relationships, feelings of helplessness, and addictive behaviors and drugs.", "Lack of responsive relationships‚ÄîChildren who experience a safe, supportive, and predictable environment develop healthy motivation systems that are driven by a balance of approach and avoidance and of wanting and liking. Children whose environment is chaotic and stressful may develop motivation systems that are driven by avoidance and fear. Expressing fear is not always a bad thing: an urgent warning from a parent when a child is moving a finger toward an electrical socket will help the child learn to avoid the socket. But excessive or misdirected fear by a primary caregiver can lead a child to lose interest in healthy exploration.", "Feeling helpless‚ÄîThe motivation to act requires some expectation of success. When children do not see any effects from their actions, they experience ‚Äúlearned helplessness.‚Äù If skills and talents are thought of as fixed‚Äîsomething people either have or dont have‚Äîan initial failure is likely to be attributed to a lack of natural ability and, in turn, may decrease motivation. But if skills and talents are seen as capacities that can be developed through practice‚Äîa growth mindset‚Äî then a failure signals the need to develop the skill or talent through continued effort and practice.", "Addictive drugs and behaviors‚ÄîPleasure-stimulating activities, such as alcohol, drugs, gambling, or casual sex, provide a short-cut to pleasure. These experiences can quickly ramp up good feelings and tamp down bad feelings‚Äî but only temporarily. This can create a spiral of dysregulation, in which the addictive experience triggers initial pleasure, followed by negative emotions and physical craving, which can only be suppressed by the addictive behavior. Addictive drugs also release more pleasure-seeking hormones than natural rewards. Over time, this overstimulation can change the neural pathways and chemistry in the motivation system. The repeated use of a short-cut to pleasure creates circuitry that is so strongly associated with memories of pleasure that the ‚Äúwanting‚Äù system produces powerful urges to follow it, even when the pleasure itself fades."],

This kind of income can come from various sources, including investments, rental properties, or digital products.", "Imagine waking up to money in your account from work you did weeks or even months ago. Thats the allure of passive income. Its about creating a system that generates revenue continuously, freeing you from the daily grind of a typical job. You can focus on what truly matters to you ‚Äî whether thats spending time with family, pursuing hobbies, or simply enjoying life.", "The Myth of Complete Passivity While the concept of passive income sounds appealing, its essential to debunk the myth of complete passivity. The reality is that every passive income stream requires some level of initial effort and ongoing maintenance. Think of it as planting a garden; you must prepare the soil, plant the seeds, and nurture them before you can enjoy the fruits of your labour.Even the most automated income streams need attention. Whether its managing investments or updating a digital product, you will need to stay engaged. The goal is to create systems that demand less of your time as they mature, but they will never be entirely hands-off. Embracing this reality is crucial foWhy Passive Income Matters Passive income is a game changer in the pursuit of financial freedom. It alleviates the constraints of living paycheck to paycheck and gives you the flexibility to make choices that align with your values and dreams. Here are a few reasons why passive income should be a part of your financial strategy: Time Freedom: With passive income, you are not tied to a desk or a specific schedule. You can allocate your time to what you truly enjoy. Financial Security: Multiple income streams can provide a safety net, reducing the risk associated with relying on a single job. Wealth Building: Passive income can significantly contribute to your overall wealth, allowing you to invest more and grow your financial portfolio over time. Legacy Creation: Passive income streams can continue to provide for your loved ones, creating a lasting financial legacy.", "Creating Your Passive Income Creating passive income involves leveraging your skills, assets, or resources. The key is to find what aligns with your interests and strengths. Here are some strategies to consider: Investing in Dividend Stocks: This is one of the simplest ways to start earning passive income. By purchasing shares in dividend-paying companies, you can receive regular payments without selling your stocks. Real Estate Investments: Whether through rental properties or Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), real estate can provide consistent income. Its a tangible asset that can appreciate over time.", "Digital Products: If you have expertise in a particular area, consider creating digital products such as eBooks, online courses, or templates. Once created, these products can sell repeatedly with minimal effort. Affiliate Marketing: Promote products or services and earn commissions on sales made through your links. This can be done through blogs, social media, or email newsletters.", "Investing in Dividend Stocks Investing in dividend stocks is an excellent starting point for creating passive income. When you buy shares in a company that pays dividends, you become a part-owner of that company. In return, the company shares a portion of its profits with you, typically on a quarterly basis. To maximise your returns, look for companies with a strong history of consistent dividend payments. Research their financial health, growth potential, and market position. Diversifying your investments across various sectors can also help reduce risk. By reinvesting your dividends, you can compound your returns over time, accelerating your wealth-building journey.", "Real Estate as a Wealth Builder Real estate has long been a popular avenue for generating passive income. Purchasing rental properties can provide a steady income stream through tenant payments. If owning property seems daunting, consider investing in REITs, which allow you to invest in real estate portfolios without the hassle of being a landlord. Real estate investments not only provide rental income but also have the potential for appreciation. Over time, property values can increase, giving you equity and financial stability. However, its crucial to conduct thorough research and understand the market before diving in. Consider factors such as location, property condition, and market trends to make informed decisions.", "The Power of Digital Products In todays digital age, creating and selling digital products offers an exciting opportunity for passive income. Whether its designing online courses, writing eBooks, or developing templates, the possibilities are endless. Once you have created a product, it can be sold repeatedly without significant additional effort. Platforms like Udemy, Gumroad, and Canva make it easy to distribute your digital products. Not only can you reach a global audience, but you can also set your own prices and retain a large portion of the profits. This model allows you to leverage your expertise and creativity, turning your passions into a sustainable income stream."],

By embracing journaling as a tool to fully experience and explore your emotions free from judgment, you open the door to valuable insights that foster personal growth and development. In this post, we will explore the benefits of emotional journaling with different ideas for how to use journaling to process emotions.", "The Challenge of Understanding Emotions", "Emotions form the core of our being and greatly shape our interactions with the world. Emotions themselves do not fall into the categories of ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad,‚Äù as each emotion holds a significant place within the human experience. However, the way we process our emotions can either transform them into negative or positive encounters. One obstacle to understanding emotions is their inherent complexity. They can emerge as a mix of various feelings, blending together and creating a unique emotional landscape within us. This complexity can make it difficult to decipher and label our emotions accurately, especially when they appear contradictory or overlapping.", "The complexity of emotions often makes it challenging to pinpoint and identify the precise feelings you are undergoing. It is not uncommon to experience a multitude of emotions concurrently, even when they seem to contradict each other regarding a particular issue. If you struggle to differentiate between anger and sadness, it becomes difficult to effectively navigate and resolve these emotions. Another challenge arises from the fact that emotions are deeply personal and subjective. While researchers have identified 27 different emotional categories, the way individuals experience and interpret their emotions can vary greatly. One persons expression of anger may differ significantly from anothers, leading to potential misunderstandings and misinterpretations.", "Societal and cultural influences can also shape our understanding and expression of emotions. Society often attaches certain expectations or norms to specific emotions, which can lead to suppression, denial, or misinterpretation of our true emotional experiences. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to cultivate emotional self-awareness and develop a vocabulary to articulate and understand our feelings more precisely. This involves paying close attention to bodily sensations, thoughts, and behaviors associated with different emotions. Engaging in practices like journaling, therapy, or mindfulness can provide valuable insights and tools to navigate the complex terrain of emotions.", "Embracing the challenge of understanding emotions is an ongoing journey of self-discovery and growth. By actively exploring and acknowledging our emotions through journaling, we can deepen our emotional intelligence, enhance our relationships, and foster a more authentic connection with ourselves and others.", "The Benefits of Journaling to Process Emotions", "Journaling to process emotions can help you make sense of your feelings, identify them, understand where they originate, and learn how to best respond to them. For example, if you feel nervous about talking to your employer about a raise in pay, journaling about it may help you recognize where that nervousness comes from. Once you have identified the source of your anxiety, you can decide ahead of time how to deal with it and the best approach to the positive outcome you want. ", "Journaling about your emotion can also help you better understand exactly what you are feeling. With practice, you will be able to recognize, ‚ÄúI am angry‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am feeling fearful.‚Äù Once you understand your emotions, you can take the appropriate steps to deal with them in a helpful way. When you spend time journaling to release emotions, you also have an opportunity to see a situation more clearly. Once you pour the rush of feelings into a journal, you can look back at your words to learn more about your actions and reactions. All of this can also help boost your emotional resilience.", "In addition to emotional processing, journaling benefits include:", "Reduced stress and anxiety, Increased self-awareness, Improved mental health, Improved mood, Less rumination (overthinking), Lower blood pressure, Improved emotional regulation, Better overall well-being , Fewer negative thoughts, Deepened self-discovery, Ability to express emotions in a healthy way, Improved ability to process emotions", "5 Tips for Effective Emotional Journaling", "Feelings may be complicated, but journaling to process emotions does not need to be.

The recommendations included within this review are related to mental well-being, exercise, cognitively stimulating activities, sleep, nutrition, and social connectedness.

The survey was performed on 2,287 randomly selected, community dwelling adults in the USA. The subgroup age over 50 (N = 1,263) was analyzed to better understand the relationship between mental well-being and brain health in this group. It was found that people who scored higher on the scale of mental well-being tended to report better memory and thinking skills than those who reported lower mental well-being. Furthermore, the AARP found that when a subject rated their episodic memory and executive function as excellent or very good, they also reported very high rates of mental well-being. Comparatively, those who rated the same functions as average, fair, or poor reported low rates of mental well-being. Interestingly, the largest difference shown was in how people rated their mental sharpness. Those who rated themselves as having low mental sharpness reported a nearly 17-point difference (38.8 compared to 55.5) in mental well-being from those who said their mental sharpness was excellent or very good (8). Based on the results of this survey, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between mental well-being and brain health.", "Our literature search shows many scientific studies that explore the same hypothesis. For example, Sutin, Stephan, and Terracciano (9) evaluated the roles of optimism and life purpose in brain health. They found that greater optimism, positive attitude, positive affect, life satisfaction, and purpose in life were associated with reduced risk of dementia. When this data was combined with socioeconomic, psychological, and generational variables, they discovered that a sense of a purpose in life was one of the strongest predictors of better brain health. Furthermore, the study found that having a purpose in life was associated with a 20% reduction in dementia risk. An additional study conducted by Galderisi et al. corroborated these findings and suggested that a meaningful and goal-driven life also reduces the risk of dementia (10)."],

When I eventually made it to the gym, my next micro habit was to simply walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes each day. Two years later, I ran my first 10K race ‚Äî something I would been trying to do unsuccessfully for a couple of decades.

We know this thanks to the groundbreaking work of UChicago Prof. Allan Rechtschaffen, a sleep research pioneer and longtime director of the UChicago Sleep Laboratory. Rechtschaffen was driven by a desire to understand why we sleep. All mammals, birds and reptiles sleep in some form or another, and nearly all animals exhibit some sort of resting or sleep-like behavior. But how and why is it beneficial to any species to spend a significant portion of its life unconscious, unable to search for food or shelter, to reproduce or to avoid predators?", "In 1983, Rectschaffen made a major discovery: without sleep, a mammal will die.

His 1939 textbook, Sleep and Wakefulness, has long been considered a foundational text for sleep researchers around the world. His work using all-night electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings allowed Kleitman and his team to chart the sequence of sleep patterns in the brain over the course of the night.", "The neuronal cells of the brain use electrical signaling to send and receive messages throughout the brain and body.

Having strong empathic tendencies has been linked to stronger relationships, reduced anxiety, and noteworthy collaboration between team members. It might seem like a basic human trait but this sense of compassion has to be constantly nurtured, something a little more complicated to do through an email. ", "The human brain is conditioned for face-to-face interactions. During any conversation, the brain takes in new information and sends out impulses for what to say and do, while monitoring ones exchanges by discouraging emotional impulses that might lead the interaction in a negative way. Online communication is very different; in-person social cues we are accustomed to get lost. Instead, we are forced to gamble on cognitive empathy, and respond solely on the information provided. Its much harder to convey your emotions- an important aspect in building strong relationships. ", "Though emails and text messages are appropriate for giving and receiving information, there is a natural adversity to these forms of communication. Positive online correspondence typically comes across as indifferent to the reader, while emails that senders identify as neutral generally come across as unfriendly. In an effort to counteract these effects, exchanges should be more personable. By purposefully connecting with individuals, we can reduce miscommunication and develop stronger, more productive relationships. ", "Empathy can be taught. Here is some advice for improving empathy in a majorly digital world: Remember to be grateful for whatever you have; with more recognition comes more humanity. Video conference or talk on the phone whenever available. With programs like Skype or Zoom, you are able to maintain a sense of in-person face-to-face interactions. Emotional cues and vocal inflections are easier to recognize over these platforms and aid in cultivating virtual relationships. Continue to build relationships with your team members and outside your organization. Simple acts such as asking someone how they are doing, especially in such difficult times, can be incredibly beneficial. Get to know the people you interface with and help them feel seen and heard; it will make a huge difference. Intentionally listen to understand. This is a behavior we talk about a lot at the Servant Leadership Institute. Its not easy, but its important if you want to build healthy relationships. By actively listening to others, you are respecting their contribution. Allow them room to develop their thoughts and ideas before collaborating. Never make assumptions. Everyone has their own valid story and experience in which they are entitled. When you assume something about another persons situation, you are putting your own prejudice and opinions into the narrative. As a consequence, you can not empathize in the right way, because you have changed their story. Try to remain neutral until you have heard their entire side. ", "To put it simply, be brave enough to recognize what the people around you are dealing with in their lives. We all have our own individual stories with different highs and lows, so challenge yourself to see, hear, and accept what you do not know. This might result in an apology, a celebration between co-workers, or the cultivation of a new relationship; be open to any and all possibilities. As we navigate further into the digital world, empathy is the golden ticket that will allow us to lay a stronger foundation for our future. We are not lacking in successful professionals; we are lacking leaders who recognize the value of empathy.

A long-term buy-and-hold strategy means you are not always focused on the market unlike traders so you can spend time doing things you love instead of being chained to watching the market all day. Risks: To succeed with this strategy, you will need to avoid the temptation to sell when the market gets rough. You will have to endure the markets sometimes steep falls, and a 50 percent or greater drop is possible, with individual stocks potentially falling even more. Thats easier said than done.", "2. Buy index funds This strategy is all about finding an attractive stock index and then buying an index fund based on it. Two popular indexes are the Standard & Poors 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Each has many of the markets top stocks, giving you a well-diversified collection of investments, even if its the only investment you own. (This list of best index funds can get you started.) Rather than trying to beat the market, you simply own the market through the fund and get its returns. Advantages: Buying an index fund is a simple approach that can yield great results, especially when you pair it with a buy-and-hold mentality. Your return will be the weighted average of the index assets. And with a diversified portfolio, you will have lower risk than owning just a few stocks. Plus, you wont have to analyze individual stocks to invest in, so it requires much less work, meaning you have time to spend on other fun things while your money works for you. Risks: Investing in stocks can be risky, but owning a diversified portfolio of stocks is considered a safer way to do it. But if you want to achieve the markets long-term returns an average of about 10 percent annually for the S&P 500 you will need to hold on through the tough times and not sell. Also, because you are buying a collection of stocks, you will get their average return, not the return of the hottest stocks. That said, most investors, even the pros, struggle to beat the indexes over time.", "3. Index and a few The ‚Äúindex and a few‚Äù strategy is a way to use the index fund strategy and then add a few small positions to the portfolio. For example, you might have 94 percent of your money in index funds and 3 percent in each of Apple and Amazon if you think those companies are well-positioned for the long term. This is a good way for beginners to keep to a mostly lower-risk index strategy but add a little exposure to individual stocks that they like. Advantages: This strategy takes the best of the index fund strategy lower risk, less work, good potential returns and lets the more ambitious investors add a few positions. The individual positions can help beginners get their feet wet on analyzing and investing in stocks, while not costing too much if these investments dont work out well."],

Tell couscous to turn into a French fry, and we'll talk. Until then, the potato is king simply because it can be whatever you want it to be.  That's what makes the Bullet Journal so special. The market is saturated with every planner you could dream up, but somehow not one - no matter how fancy - perfectly serves your needs. It's just couscous trying to turn into a French fry. But the Bullet Journal is different. It starts with a blank journal and a pen which is deceptively simple and almost boring, but it's also the lazy genius organizer you've been waiting for.", "The Bullet Journal is better than your online system.", "Almost definitely. Here's why. Our brains approach analog methods differently than digital ones. Toddlers navigate iPads better than their degree-toting older relatives, so all the smart people have become increasingly interested in what damage (if any) this is doing to the brain. ", "I'm not here to tell you to stop you or your kids from using screens; that would be ridiculous and mean hallelujah TV. But there is something different about going analog. Have you ever edited a term paper or manuscript on your computer? You always end up printing the whole thing and flipping pages with pen in hand because for some reason it works better. Studies show this is why:", "Whether they realize it or not, many people approach computers and tablets with a state of mind less conducive to learning than the one they bring to paper.", "Our brains behave differently when we go analog, and that's why the Bullet Journal is a great system. It engages your brain and encourages more thorough thought processes. Plus you get to buy an awesome pen. Still, even though the act of writing is romantic and gratifying, it does take longer. Which seems dumb and anti-genius, so why do it? Because the Bullet Journal, by design, helps you decide what matters and what doesn't. If it's not important enough to write down any number of times, it's not important enough to keep in your life. Simple but extremely effective.", "Your Bullet Journal will not replace your smartphone. I might die without immediate access to podcasts, but phones can't contain everything, not in one visual place anyway. And you can't save the information on your phone in the same way you can within a book spine. Once a Bullet Journal is full, it lives on your shelf with what will eventually become a lifetime of others, and you'll have the best bird's eye view of your life that no technology can match. ", "The Bullet Journal can be set up in the next five minutes.", "If you're hesitant to buy a new journal before you know if you'll use it (valid decision by the way), grab an old steno notebook or one of the dozens of barely-used journals on your shelf. (I'm the president of Journal Hoarders of America, so I do not judge.) Now let's take a few minutes to do a quick set-up so you can see everything in action.", "The Backbone Pages of the Bullet Journal", "Open to the first spread of blank pages. This is your Index page. If the Bullet Journal is a potato, the Index is fat. You can use whatever kind of fat you want - olive oil, bacon, butter - but it's hard to grasp the beauty of the simple boiled potato without a little liquid cholesterol. Fat makes potatoes sing, i.e. your Index makes your Bullet Journal a magical device no matter what form you use. It often takes a little time to realize that, but don't skip or ignore the Index.", "One of the best qualities of the Bullet Journal is that nothing has to be written consecutively. In fact, it serves its purpose best when you simply write any new information on the next blank page. There's no saving pages or having empty sections (like in other planners), so there's no waste. You simply find things via the Index. It doesn't have to be fancy; it's what you'd expect - a list of page descriptions and their corresponding page numbers so you can find what you need when you need it. You'll fill it up over time, but for now, simply title that first page 'Index,' write the appropriate page numbers at the bottom (presumably 1 and 2), and add those pages to your actual Index.", "The Bullet Journal takes a focused look at one month at a time which is great for the month but tricky when recording things that will happen down the road. That's why the Future Log is so fly. ", "The versions of set-up are infinite, but trial and error have taught me to keep my Bullet Journal as mind-numbingly simple as possible. If an appointment or lunch date or food truck festival is coming my way, I simply write a box, the date, and the event. Done. We'll talk more about the execution later, so just write 'Future Log' at the top of the page, number the page, and add it to your Index. You'll want it near the front of your Bullet Journal, so best to do it now.", "I love that you don't have to start your Bullet Journal in January for it to be effective. Simply begin where you are. If you're reading this in May, your first Monthly Log will be May. Write the month at the top of the next blank page, and write the days of the month down the side. It's also helpful to write the first letter of the corresponding day of the week so you know when the actual date falls. You can do this on the left or right of the number; the creator of the Bullet Journal puts his on the right, and I put mine on the left. You choose."],

The purpose of mindful eating is not to lose weight, although it is highly likely that those who adopt this style of eating will lose weight. The intention is to help individuals savor the moment and the food and encourage their full presence for the eating experience.", "Mindfulness is a process-oriented, rather than an outcome-driven, behavior. It is based on an individuals experience of the moment. The individual focuses on appreciating the experience of food and is not concerned with restricting intake. The person eating chooses what and how much to consume. It is not coincidental that, within a mindful approach, the persons choices often are to eat less, savor eating more, and select foods consistent with desirable health benefits.", "The raisin experience is a wonderful example of what mindful eating can be, with its intention to focus on various aspects of the moment-by-moment experience. The focus on the sensual experiences of sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste brings about the full awareness of the food in the moment. This process does not tell you what you should experience; it only suggests that you notice your own experience.

In fact, 71 percent of employers value emotional intelligence more than technical skills when evaluating candidates.", "Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence the emotions of those around you. The term was first coined in 1990 by researchers John Mayer and Peter Salovey but was later popularized by psychologist Daniel Goleman. More than a decade ago, Goleman highlighted the importance of emotional intelligence in leadership, telling the Harvard Business Review, ‚ÄúThe most effective leaders are all alike in one crucial way: They all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. Its not that IQ and technical skills are irrelevant. They do matter, but...they are the entry-level requirements for executive positions.‚Äù", "Over the years, emotional intelligence‚Äîalso known as EQ‚Äîhas evolved into a must-have skill. Research by EQ provider TalentSmart shows that it's the strongest predictor of performance, further illustrating why emotional intelligence is important. Employees with high emotional intelligence are more likely to stay calm under pressure, resolve conflict effectively, and respond to co-workers with empathy. How to Identify a Lack of Emotional Intelligenc A lack of emotional intelligence skills often results in workplace conflicts and misunderstandings. This dynamic often stems from an inability to recognize or comprehend emotions. One of the most common indicators of low emotional intelligence is difficulty managing and expressing emotions. You might struggle with acknowledging colleagues' concerns appropriately or wrestle with active listening.", "Consider the relationships you have with your co-workers.

Working with colleagues who are not self-aware can cut a teams success in half and, according to Eurichs research, lead to increased stress and decreased motivation. To bring out the best in others, you first need to bring out the best in yourself, which is where self-awareness comes into play. One easy way to assess your self-awareness is by completing 360-degree feedback, in which you evaluate your performance and then match it up against the opinions of your boss, peers, and direct reports.

It's important to pause, breathe, collect yourself, and do whatever it takes to manage your emotions‚Äîwhether that means taking a walk or calling a friend‚Äîso that you can more appropriately and intentionally respond to stress and adversity.", "While its important to understand and manage your emotions, you also need to know how to read a room.

While some people opt for a new gym membership or weekly yoga classes in order to invest in a new physical health regime, others may seek to invest in a positive change for their mental health and well-being, like introducing reflective practices into their daily routine.", "So.. how does reflective journaling differ from regular journaling, you ask? Being reflective is the process of using metacognition, which refers to taking the time to think on a deeper level about one‚Äôs own thinking, in order to acquire a different perspective of these thoughts that may have been overlooked at first. Reflection allows an individual to more carefully consider the profound experiences that have impacted on their lives, or become critically aware of how these experiences have shaped them in some way.", " Some of the positive outcomes or benefits of reflective journaling can include: ", "become more aware of 'the self' or inner thoughts, fears, desires and values explore a previous memory, experience, or event on a deeper, more meaningful level enter into novel situations with an increasingly critical introspect (examination of one's own thoughts or feelings) in order to take an informed decision align future hopes, expectations or goals with current values or beliefs‚Äã Use caution when uncovering difficult experiences. ‚ÄãThe process of reflecting on ones metacognitions can be an enlightening and positive experience, but it also has the potential to uncover suppressed and unpleasant emotional experiences that can unknowingly be triggered during this process. Apply caution before exploring any triggering thoughts too quickly or deeply, and seek external support from others as needed.", "Next, let's consider the steps  to start the process of reflective journaling. You may want to go through the following checklist first in preparation:", "have a writing tool and place to record your reflections, such as a notepad, online document, or a journal app find a quiet ,comfortable environment to ensure you have time to ponder ensure that you are ready to assume a contemplative & reflective head-space prepare to allow yourself to write in an honest and natural manner (don't hold back - this journal can remain private, for your eyes only) allow for time following your reflections to process any emotional triggers that may happen during or following the journaling process Now let's go through a step-by-step process that you can use to set up your reflective journal (you can spend more time at a particular step, or alter each step, to suit your needs):", "1) Brainstorm ideas", "It can help to create a list of possibilities to write about, such as ideas, concepts, beliefs, values, stories, memories, and anything else that may surface in your mind. Having this list nearby can help you to draw inspiration throughout the reflective process. You may also want to consider using a mind-map, haphazardly jotting down thoughts as they come to your mind, or practice free writing ( prewriting technique in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without regard to spelling, grammar or topic). If you have other strategies that have worked for you to generate new ideas, feel free to use them now.", "2) Reflect on your current emotional and physical state", "Consider your present emotional state in order to prepare yourself to be able to critically reflect on thoughts and feelings at a deeper level. One way of doing this is to consider what words, images, colours or designs would help you to describe your emotions. Take some time to think about your emotions through a microscope.. what do you see? In a similar fashion, consider your present physical state in terms of how your body feels at this particular moment in time.. are you noticing any tension, stress, soreness? How might you be able to alleviate these discomforts in order to feel more relaxed and settle into the writing process?", "3) Start asking yourself critical & profound questions", "This step is the heart of the reflective journaling process, and sometimes the most uncomfortable. It's time to get really personal with yourself and start asking bold questions that explore the depth and meaning of who you are as a person. What do you really want to know about yourself (or others, or the universe) but haven't had the chance or forum to ask yet? The goal is to critically challenge your way of thinking to discover a new perspective."],

Emotional strength is defined as the ability to respond in an open and vulnerable way in the face of intense emotional experience, feeling one's way deeper into the emotion which allows access to implicit functional processes driving action. We present four hallmarks of emotional strength: (i) openness and vulnerability (ii) emotional responsiveness (iii) self-description using vulnerability-related words (iv) continuing engagement in action. Emotional strength is distinguished from psychological constructs such as mindfulness, emotion regulation, emotion-approach coping, resilience, emotional intelligence, emotion-focused therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. It is not the point of emotional strength to turn a negative into a positive experience. The skill is to feel deeply into all emotion experience, opening up vulnerability and emotional responsiveness and to change the way emotion is understood in everyday life.", "Of the number of fundamental changes that signalled the beginning of the modern period, it has been argued that central among these were an increased sensitivity to suffering and an affirmation of the importance of ordinary life (Taylor, 1989). These two features of modern life combine to place great impetus on some concept that is contrary to suffering and that can be applied in ordinary life ‚Äî this place usually being occupied by the notions happiness, flourishing, or well-being. But unfortunately, there are a series of related asymmetries between the negative and the positive in this context, that render the predicate contrary to suffering highly problematic.", "Emotional strength is a way of responding to emotion experience that differs from other emotion-related terms in the affect literature. Its primary difference is that it refers to feeling one's way deeper into the emotion during an emotion episode that is imbued with an experience of emotional vulnerability rather than being grounded in attention or cognitions about emotions. Emotional strength can also be used in a dispositional sense, as a stable tendency to this type of response to emotion experience. Finally, as well as naming a type of actual response and response disposition, emotional strength can also assume the role of an organizing principle for practical conduct. This is well illustrated by Schore:", "But before we begin our discussion of emotional strength, we briefly signpost a few fixed points in emotion theory that contemporary researchers have found compelling. This we hope will clear the conceptual space for seeing the importance of a research focus on active response to emotion experience, and for the discussion of emotional strength that follows.", "Having sketched the conceptual space that we take to be a compelling framework for person-level emotion research, we turn now to the main task of the paper, to present emotional strength.", "The term emotional strength (ES) refers primarily to a way of responding to occurrent emotion.

The path is steep, the weather unpredictable, and unforeseen obstacles constantly arise. As the leader, your ability to navigate through these challenges and guide your team to the summit is crucial. The key ingredient? Resilience. Walt Disneys words eloquently capture the essence of resilience, and the philosophy rings true not only in life but also in the demanding world of business leadership, where tough times are inevitable.", "To carve a path to reach our goals in the volatile business world means our role must extend beyond setting strategies and driving performance. We are the beacons of steadiness and restoration when the unexpected hits. This month, we have been uncovering the essence of Developing Leadership Skills and the compelling need for leaders to harness the right tools and mindset to build resilient teams. In this final article of the series, we explore the fortifying pillars that create an unbreakable chain of resilience, ensuring that each team member is equipped to handle the tides of change and hardship.", "The concept of resilience in leadership is multifaceted. Resilience is more than the ability to bounce back from setbacks; it is also about being adaptable in the face of change, maintaining a positive outlook during difficulties, and viewing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. In essence, resilience is a transformative process that invites us to evolve both personally and professionally  an essential leadership skill. Here is why resilience is so crucial It fosters adaptability: A resilient team can adjust to changing circumstances, embrace new strategies, and find creative solutions to overcome challenges. It promotes mental toughness: Resilient teams are better equipped to handle setbacks and bounce back from failures, maintaining motivation and focus during difficult periods. It strengthens team spirit: When faced with adversity, resilient teams demonstrate a sense of unity and support for one another, fostering a stronger sense of collective purpose. It inspires confidence: Leaders who display resilience inspire confidence in their team, setting a positive example and boosting overall morale.", "In the contemporary business world, marked by rapid technological advancements, global interconnectedness, and instability in so many areas, the importance of resilience cannot be overstated.

A resilient leader sees through these phases, acting as the stabiliser and visionary who charts the course to sustainability and success.", "Drawing lessons from a previous article, Embracing Emotional Intelligence: The Heart of Leadership Success, we recognise that the root of resilience is emotional intelligence (EI). A leader high in EI is self-aware, exercises self-regulation, and displays empathy all crucial for nurturing a resilient team. Such leaders can gauge the emotional temperature of their team and provide support or challenge as needed. They create an environment where open communication is valued, and team members feel respected and understood.Another cornerstone to building a resilient team is clarity of decision-making as we explored in Decision-Making Mastery: Unlock Your Leadership Potential and Transform Indecision into Impact, coupled with effective delegation as we saw in Delegating for Success: The Leaders Path to Effective Execution. Resilient teams are composed of individuals who are encouraged to make and own their decisions. This empowerment provides for a sense of agency and confidence, enabling them to act decisively, even when the road ahead is uncertain. A resilient leader, therefore, does not merely instruct but collaborates, guiding the team to become adept at navigating complex situations.", "By intertwining emotional intelligence with strong decision-making abilities, leaders can construct a foundation solid enough to withstand even the toughest of times.

    "content": ["How can you ensure a thriving, long-lasting relationship? While a multitude of factors can tell you if someone is the right partner for you, there is one trait that has been scientifically linked to happier and more satisfying relationships: emotional intelligence. While emotional intelligence is a buzzword in the workforce, its also a key indicator of relationship fulfillment. Research has shown that being able to have productive conversations, including disagreements, predicts a couples long-term success. Another study showed that people with high self-reports of marital satisfaction are more likely to openly discuss relationship problems with their partner and consider their significant other to be emotionally intelligent. ", "So how do you know if you or your partner are emotionally intelligent? And if one or both of you have low EQ, is there anything you can do about it? In this article, we will break down what high and low emotional intelligence looks like in intimate partnerships and how to develop it in your relationship. But first, let is take a look at what we currently know about emotional intelligence. ", "Overview of Emotional Intelligence in Relationship. Recent research found that 74% of married couples in the United States are happily married. These couples reported that the reasons for their happy unions are strong communication skills, mutual respect and a deep emotional connection. People who are naturally more optimistic also find it easier to maintain a happy marriage. What do all of these factors have in common? You guessed it ‚Äî emotional intelligence. The ability to communicate clearly, especially about more difficult emotional topics, is a pillar of EQ. Overall emotional well-being, or having an overall positive view of life, is also a factor. Emotional intelligence is defined as ‚Äúthe ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions.", "There are five factors of EQ: self-awareness, social awareness, emotional control, empathy and emotional well-being. When some or all of these factors are missing from the relationship, it will shape the way the couple communicates, deals with conflict and the overall relationship dynamic. ", "Emotional intelligence is a key factor in building and maintaining healthy relationships. By understanding and managing your own emotions and the emotions of others, you can create stronger, more satisfying relationships with friends, family and co-workers. People with low EQ tend to struggle in relationships. Struggling to understand your emotions or those of others can make constructive conversations especially difficult and draining. Unfortunately, this means that those with lower emotional intelligence often have to work extra hard on their relational dynamics and experience more challenges. " , "On the other hand, people who score high in some factors of EQ may also struggle in their relationships. Empathetic people may avoid conflict to ‚Äúkeep the peace‚Äù and get along with others, and in doing this, are actually suppressing their own wants and needs. This can lead to resentment and dissatisfaction in the long term. A 2016 study also found that individuals with high self-awareness have an increased likelihood of dealing with mental health challenges like anxiety and depression. ", "For these reasons, its essential to aim for balance when it comes to developing your EQ. For example, if you score high in empathy but low in emotional control, developing that facet of EQ can help you have more productive conversations that dont shy away from conflict. (You can pinpoint which exact factors you may need to work on by taking Truitys free EQ test.) ", "People with balanced emotional intelligence are able to balance their own needs and the needs of others. They are assertive and direct, but they are also understanding and compassionate. They are able to read social cues and understand the emotions of others, and can also communicate their own emotions effectively, allowing them to build strong relationships. People with exceptional EQ do not lose themselves in trying to win approval or worrying about what others think. They know that their feelings and desires matter as much as their partners or anyone elses, so they are able to set boundaries and assert themselves when necessary.", "Choosing a romantic partner is one of the most important decisions you will ever make. And when it comes to happy partnerships, EQ matters. So how do you know if your partner is emotionally intelligent? Here are some signs to look for. They are self-aware. Self-aware people understand their emotions and can recognize why they feel the way that they do. Pay attention to how your partner talks about their thoughts and feelings. Do they feel comfortable talking about their emotions? If they feel down or frustrated, can they explain why? Are they able to bounce back from negative moods quickly? If so, they likely have high EQ. ", "They are socially connected. Emotionally intelligent people tend to have good interpersonal skills, which leads to long-lasting, fulfilling relationships. Being emotionally intelligent doesnt mean that they have to be a social butterfly, but if their interpersonal relationships are characterized by drama and frequent fallouts, it could indicate that they are lacking in the EQ department. They are there for you. Emotionally intelligent people are not mind-readers, but they do pay attention to how other people are feeling and offer empathy and support when needed. Does your partner notice when you are feeling down and ask for details? Or do they show a lack of interest in how you are feeling? The latter may indicate low EQ. "],

Findings indicated highest mean value of emotional intelligence for motivation and empathy. Majority students showed active problem and emotional coping behavior; however, a strong, positive correlation between emotional intelligence and stress coping style was found for the domains associated with Active Emotional and Problem. It revealed that students are efficient in utilizing stress coping strategies and recommended that professors should provide guidance to students regarding emotional intelligence and stress coping styles.", "The understanding of the concept of emotional intelligence and methods of coping with psychological stress is very important, since both of them are highly influential in the success growth and development of an individual. The relationship was first identified by Salovey and Sluyter (1997), who indicated that emotional intelligence enables a person to understand his feelings and emotions resulting in directing his actions (Cherniss, 2000; Jones and Hutchins, 2004). For Goleman and Cherniss (2000), emotional intelligence is the individuals ability to curb negative emotions of anger, low self-esteem, and anxiety and replacing them with positive emotions such as confidence, empathy and friendship (Gayathri and Vimala, 2015).", "Individuals with weak emotional intelligence face several difficulties in managing stress-related issues. This fact is endorsed from different studies which suggest a strong association between stress and emotional intelligence (Sharma and Kumar, 2016). An uncontrolled stress is often associated with physical and mental disorders that ultimately lead to psychological issues including conflicts, aggressive behavior and poor compatibility. Stressed individuals are unable to adopt the appropriate positive methods and techniques needed to minimize the negative effects of stress on physical and mental health (Yousuf, 2007).", "Bar-On (2010) showed that emotional intelligence exercises a significant impact on an individuals capacity of positive social interaction. However, an individuals ability to cope up in a stressful situation depends on different factors such as; emotional competence, empathy, self-monitoring, and intensity and duration of distress among individuals (Brink, 2009). Kova√æevi√º et al. (2018) indicated that stress coping strategies are either adaptive or maladaptive. In adaptive behavior, a person successfully deals with the stressful situations to minimize any danger, whereas, in maladaptive behavior, results may not be significantly beneficial as it makes even more difficult for a person to survive in his surroundings. Adaptive strategies contribute toward an individuals overall wellbeing in health, productivity, personal satisfaction, and growth. Wang et al. (2016) identified a direct influence of self-leadership with active coping style. Another study indicated that emotional intelligence and stress-coping strategies significantly affect individuals self-efficacy (Morales-Rodr√≠guez and P√©rez-M√°rmol, 2019).", "Since the concept of emotional intelligence and coping strategies is essential for an individuals wellbeing, investigations regarding the level of stress and emotional intelligence faced by students is critical. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify the nature of relationship between emotional intelligence and methods of coping with stress faced by the students. This study contributes significantly in the domain of student psychology as it analyzed psychological variables necessary for a students effective academic performance and wellbeing. This study is also important as it has used students as a study sample, who, as per researchers knowledge, have not been studied before on the basis of variables included in this study: gender, specialization, study level, and marital status. Considering this, the present study attempts to answer the following research questions:", "What is the level of emotional intelligence in students? What is the level of methods of coping with psychological stress in students? Is there a correlation between the degree of emotional intelligence and degree of methods of coping with stress? Is there a significant difference in the level of emotional intelligence in students on the basis of gender (male, female), specialization (Arts and Sciences, Business, Law), and marital status (single, married)? Hypothesis development Considering the aim of this study, following hypothesis were tested. There is a strong correlation between the degree of emotional intelligence and methods of coping with stress in students.", "Emotional intelligence is related to the individuals ability to deal with stress. People face different challenges in: (a) defining and meeting their goals and needs, (b) achieving personal and social harmony, and (c) developing interaction with the environment. A continuous process of alignment between individuals personal characteristics and external conditions is essential. This type of alignment is achieved and maintained via activating an individuals potential of utilizing stress coping strategies through which he seeks to create balance between himself and his external circumstances. He does this by modulating the external factors such as mobilization of energies, modification of objectives, aspirations, and change in the environment itself (Albesher and Alsaeed, 2015).", "According to Epstein (1998), emotionally intelligent children are healthier, happier and are more adaptable and these traits lead them to desired academic achievements. Goleman (1995) noted that in certain cases, low emotional intelligence skills are characterized by an increased in rate of violent crime and teenage suicide as well as episodes of anxiety, depression, high aggression ratio, social problems, school dropouts, and disinterest in religion. Understanding of an individuals personal competence mainly self-awareness, self-regulation and motivation is critical as it determines how an individual manages his affairs."],

It is just basic math the more money you have, the more you can do with it. And one of the best ways to increase your income is to pick up a side hustle. I started my side-hustling journey in 2014. I had a full-time government job, but the pay was not great, and it did not do a lot to spark my creativity. So I started my first blog, both as a creative outlet and as a great way to earn a bit of extra income.", "In the years since then, side-hustling has helped me to pay off tens of thousands of dollars in debt and save up enough money to buy an RV, and travel the country full-time.

For others, maybe you know you want to start a side gig to earn a bit of extra money in your spare time, but you are not sure what exactly you want to do. Well, thats what this first step is for. This phase is all about brainstorming! First things first, ask yourself what you are good at and passionate about. Its important that this is not something you are going to get sick of right away! I could talk about my personal finance for hours on end, which made writing about money the perfect side hustle for me.", "In addition to finding a topic that you are passionate about, you have to make sure its something that other people are interested in as well. Because as important as it is that YOU love your side hustle, you can not make money from something that no one else will spend money on. Still short on side hustle ideas? I have got you covered! In this blog post on reasons to start a side hustle, I shared 9 awesome side hustle ideas! Those ideas include:", "Becoming a freelancer (writer, graphic designer, etc.) Starting a blog Opening an online shop Becoming a virtual assistant Selling digital products, such as an ebook or an online course Teaching a skill  Joining the gig economy", "Step 2: Do your research Let me preface this by saying that when I started my side hustle, I did zero research. I literally did not even know that blogging was a thing you could make money from when I first got started. And I certainly did not forsee being able to turn it into a six-figure freelance writing business But once I learned that it was something you could make an income from, you better believe I did a ton of research to maximize its potential. Whether the side business you are starting is a blog or something totally different, I guarantee there is tons of information available online from people who have done the same thing you are trying to do. Side hustles are quite common today, and I guarantee someone else is teaching people to do exactly what you are trying to do. Research everything from the logistics of setting up your website to marketing. Join some Facebook groups with others with the same side gig and learn from them. One thing I have learned is that online business owners seem super happy to share their knowledge and create connections with other online business owners. Its such an awesome and welcoming community."],

And that is where writing prompts can help you break that block and get typing. The idea behind a writing prompt is actually pretty simple.

However, it can also backfire by creating resentment, stress, and dependency among team members, as well as reducing their creativity and autonomy. How can you effectively manage a team without micromanaging? Here are some tips to help you strike the right balance between guidance and trust", "One of the main reasons why managers micromanage is because they are not clear about what they want from their team and how they will measure their success. To avoid this, you need to set clear and realistic expectations and goals for your team, and communicate them clearly and frequently. Make sure your team understands the scope, timeline, budget, and quality standards of each project, as well as their roles and responsibilities. Also, establish how you will monitor and evaluate their progress and performance, and how often you will provide feedback and recognition.", "Another reason why managers micromanage is because they are reluctant to delegate tasks and authority to their team members, either because they think they can do it better themselves, or because they fear losing control. To overcome this, you need to delegate and empower your team to make decisions and solve problems on their own, based on their skills, experience, and interests. Give them the resources, tools, and support they need, but also give them the freedom and flexibility to choose how they will complete their tasks. Trust them to deliver the results you expect, and avoid interfering or second-guessing their work.", "A third reason why managers micromanage is because they are not in sync with their team and lack trust and rapport with them. To prevent this, you need to communicate and collaborate with your team regularly and effectively. Use different channels and methods to communicate your vision, strategy, feedback, and appreciation, and to listen to their ideas, concerns, and feedback. Encourage open and honest communication and foster a culture of mutual respect and feedback. Also, involve your team in planning, brainstorming, and problem-solving, and leverage their diverse perspectives and talents.", "A fourth reason why managers micromanage is because they are not confident in their team's abilities and potential, or because they want to impose their own style and methods on them. To avoid this, you need to coach and mentor your team to help them grow and improve their skills, confidence, and performance. Identify their strengths and weaknesses, and provide them with constructive feedback, guidance, and resources to help them achieve their goals and overcome their challenges. Also, inspire them to learn new things, take on new challenges, and experiment with new approaches.", "A fifth reason why managers micromanage is because they are not flexible and responsive to changing situations and needs, or because they are afraid of failure and uncertainty. To overcome this, you need to adjust and adapt your management style and expectations according to your team's characteristics, preferences, and feedback, as well as the project's context, goals, and outcomes. Be willing to adjust your level of involvement, direction, and support depending on the situation and the individual. Also, be open to learning from your mistakes, failures, and feedback, and to making changes and improvements accordingly.", ""],

However, for 25 per cent of young people, procrastination is a chronic habit and causes significant issues. As not all procrastination stems from the same source, it is important to dig a little deeper into the different causes of procrastination to get on top of it.", "Procrastination can be defined as voluntarily delaying an intended course of action, despite expecting to be worse off for the delay (Steel, 2007). For students, the consequences are wide-ranging. Many teenagers have shared with me the emotional costs of the stress, guilt, disappointment and anxiety they experience. Academic costs come in the form of missed deadlines, rushed and poor-quality work, underachievement and compromised goals. Furthermore, relationships with teachers and families suffer as promises and expectations go unfulfilled.", "It is easy for parents to focus on the method of procrastination as the source of the problem: the hours spent on social media, streaming shows or gaming. There are also other forms of avoidance which are more deceptive: these include organising books, chatting to families or even sleeping, to delay study. These give us the how of avoidance but not the why. In order to break out of the procrastination trap, we need to first identify the underlying cause, which is not the same for everyone.", "What are these difficult feelings? They are a number that have been identified by various researchers such as Sapadin (2012) and Bernard (1992). They include avoidance of potential failure, disapproval, rejection, feelings of inferiority, difficulty or boredom. In my experience, the three most common types of procrastinators are:", "The worrier: who feels stressed by so much to do and lacks confidence in their own ability. The challenge is to take risks and focus on the process of learning. The dreamer: has lots of good intentions but frequently feels annoyed by boring or difficult tasks. The challenge is to tolerate feelings of discomfort and stop making excuses. The perfectionist: often feels overwhelmed by unachievable goals, believing everything has to be perfect. The challenge is to find a middle ground and aim for excellence, not perfection.", "Each of these types of procrastinators can benefit from different strategies. The perfectionist can use time limits for specific tasks and consciously practice learning to accept mistakes. The worrier can reward themselves for taking a small risk and focusing on their personal growth. The dreamer can learn the difference between feeling good (comfortable) and feeling good about themselves and changing their self-talk from I will try to I will!", "Raising this topic with teenagers can be difficult, as adolescents can easily become defensive. However, the academic costs and emotional stress are very real, so it is important to address habitual procrastination. Try to help your young person articulate the underlying cause of their avoidance in a non-judgemental way or consider having a shared conversation with a trusted teacher at school. A few sessions with the school psychologist may also help to work out underlying causes and develop new routines. Encourage your teenager to identify 4-5 practical changes they are willing to implement, balancing accountability with encouragement."],

    "content":["Positive psychology can be described as the scientific study of optimal human functioning whichfocuses upon discovering and promoting those factors that allow individuals and communities to thrive (Seligman,2000). In other words, it refers to the positive aspects of human life like well-being, happiness and life thriving etc. According to Seligman and Peterson (2005), positive psychologycan be used as an umbrella term involving positive emotions, positive character traits, and enabling institutions.Over a significantperiod, psychology has emphasized moreupon human illness, unhappiness and shortcomings than the positive aspects of human potential (Seligman, 2003). Although certain concepts of positive psychology can be traced throughout various fragments of psychology, the concept of modern positive psychology was first formally introduced by Martin Seligman in ‚ÄûBuilding Human Strengths: Psychologys Forgotten Mission‚Äü in 1998. Seligman (1999) stated three major aimsof psychology- a) to cure mental illness; b) to make lives more fulfilling; and c) to identify and nurture high talent. Positive psychology greatly emphasizes upon two major aspects of emotion, which are emotional intelligence and happiness. Individuals experience a range of emotions which are feeling states involving physiological, cognitive and behavioural reactions to instances (Passer & Smith, 2011). Emotions are broadly categorized into either six types, namely joy, surprise, sadness, fear, disgust, anger (Ekman, 1992); or eight typeswhich are grouped into four opposite pair of emotions, namely trust- distrust, surprise- anticipation, joy- sadness, anger- fear(Plutchik, 1980). Although the concept of emotional intelligence was first explored in 1990, by psychologists Peter Salovey and John Mayer in their article ‚ÄûEmotional Intelligence published in the journal Imagination, Cognition and Personality, and later popularized by Daniel Goleman in 1995 in his book ‚ÄûEmotional Intelligence: Why it can matter more than IQ, one can trace its root back to the ancient Indian period. ", "meanings embodied in various forms, shared by people in the zone of Indian civilization. Various Indian schools of thought [e.g., Hinduism(shadDarshana: Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa,Vedanta), Buddhism, Jainism, Sufism etc] cover the whole range of theistic and atheistic postulates of life; teach the art of liberation from bondage of suffering, ignorance; help in creating a social order of harmony, peace, personal growth, and transcends all religious boundaries, without offending any faith/ideology. The ancient Indian philosophy and literature including the Vedas,the Upanishads,the Yogavasishta, theBhagwadGita,the VivekaChoodamani, and great epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata have references on mind, self, and intelligence. They suggested that self-efficacy and perseverance, which are similar to self-awareness and self-management clusters of emotional intelligence can lead an individual to the path of attaining success (Goparaj and Sharma, 2011). The Indian philosophy focuses upon higher levels of self i.e., ‚ÄûAtmaBodha‚Äüwhich refers to aligning the self (Atman or soul) with the external world (Brahman) for social outcomes that are transcendental, rather than materialistic in nature. Awareness of self focuses on raising one‚Äüs level of consciousness to the extent that a person forgets about differences of self with others and treats everyone like a family The concept of ‚ÄûVasudhaivKutumbakam‚Äü refers to unity in diversity by discouraging negative stereotypes, prejudices, biases, discrimination, and encouraging individuals to treat everyone like a family, thus instilling the concept of emotional intelligence among Indians. Emotional intelligence as viewed from the Indian context proposes different traits like empathy, kindness, gratitude, respect towards elders, taking responsibility, completing one‚Äüs duties, benevolence, Ahimsa (non-violence) etc,", "which have deep connection with emotional expression,responsibility, and the potential to deal with socio-cultural and emotional situations (Anand, 2017). In India, the concept of emotional intelligence has been induced among people by various cultural and spiritual practices (Mishra, 2005).The concept of ‚ÄûSama‚Äü (avoidance of extreme) and the maintenance of balance or equilibrium in all functioning as proposed by the Sankhyaphilosophy and Bhagavad-Gita have formulated the concept of wellbeing as epitomized in the Indian tradition(Sinha,1994). According to Bhawuk (2011), the ancient Indian texts and scriptures like the Vedas, the Upanishadas, the Bhagwad Gita, which explored various aspects of happiness and well-being still influence the concepts of happy life among the modern Indians. The Ayurveda described the concepts of Swastha (health), Sukhswarup (happiness or happy life), and Dukhswarup (sadness or unhappy life).For a happy and fulfilling life, the four Purusharthas(life pursuits)- dharma(virtues,rightful obligations/duty), artha(material prosperity), kama(fulfilment of desires)and moksha(liberation) which cover the entire range of human possibilities and strivings, should be pursued in harmony with Dharma(social ethos).Attachment with worldly objects and experiences are purely temporary and are of binding nature, ultimately destroying one‚Äüs life. An individual with high intellect by denouncing ‚Äúkarmaja-fal‚Äù(outcome of karma)and overcoming ‚Äúmoh‚Äù(greed/excessive attachment)reaches an‚Äúanamaya‚Äùstate(absence of sorrow) and attains a focused state of mind(yoga prapta) respectively. Through the process of perception,a person develops the cognition(chinta)/thinks(dhyayato) excessively about an object and along with affect,an attachment(sanga)with the object is formed. Desire(kama)towards the object arises from attachment. If fulfilment of desire is thwarted,it leads to anger. Anger leads to ‚Äúsanmoha‚Äù(distorted ideas)."],

    "content":["In life's unpredictable journey, financial stability serves as a sturdy anchor during turbulent times. This month‚Äôs article offers a gentle reminder about a fundamental aspect of financial preparedness: the Emergency Fund. Life often throws unexpected curveballs our way - from sudden medical expenses to car repairs, job loss, or even natural disasters. These unforeseen events can wreak havoc on our lives and, if we are not adequately insured or prepared, on our finances. This is where the concept of an Emergency Fund comes into play.", "An Emergency Fund is a pool of money set aside specifically to cover unforeseen expenses or financial emergencies. It acts as a safety net, providing financial security and peace of mind during times of crisis. The primary purpose of an Emergency Fund is to cover essential expenses when regular income is disrupted due to health, family, or employment crises. An adequate emergency fund can prevent us from interrupting our investments' compounding at suboptimal moments in time. Every moment is suboptimal because in compounding time is our biggest ally. Albert Einstein encapsulated it well when he said, ‚Äúcompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world‚Äù.", "Financial Margin of Safety: An Emergency Fund serves as a buffer against unexpected financial setbacks, helping individuals and families weather storms without resorting to high-interest loans or dipping into long-term savings. The late Charlie Munger, one of Warren Buffets investment partners, often emphasized the importance of having an emergency fund, which provides a level of safety margin for unforeseen life events. Stress Reducer: Financial worries can take a toll on mental and emotional well-being. Knowing that you have a financial cushion in place can alleviate stress and anxiety during challenging times.Protection Against Debt: In the absence of an Emergency Fund, many individuals turn to credit cards or loans to cover unexpected expenses. This can lead to a cycle of debt with high-interest payments, further exacerbating financial strain. Having an Emergency Fund helps break this cycle by providing a source of funds without resorting to debt.", "Flexibility and Freedom: With an Emergency Fund in place, individuals have the flexibility to navigate life's uncertainties without being tethered to financial constraints. Whether it's exploring new career opportunities or taking calculated risks, an Emergency Fund provides the freedom to make choices without fear of financial ruin.Building an Emergency Fund requires discipline, commitment, and a systematic approach. Here are some steps to get started:", "Set a Goal: Determine how much you need to save for your Emergency Fund. I often recommend setting aside at least three but up to six months' worth of living expenses; the recommended amount varies based on individual circumstances. Most physicians have stable income, but over the last few years, I have seen several situations in which health concerns have disrupted income. Most commonly, disability insurance policies have a 90-day waiting period before benefits are paid. It is vital that you have a goal to cover at least the waiting period on your disability insurance policy.Automate Savings: Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to a dedicated savings account earmarked for emergencies. Automating the process ensures that saving becomes a priority, even before other expenses. Keep it Accessible but Separate: While it's essential to keep your Emergency Fund easily accessible, consider keeping it separate from your primary checking account to avoid temptation. High-yield savings accounts at places like American Express, Ally Bank, and Marcus offer both accessibility and modest returns. Regularly Review and Replenish: Life circumstances change, and so do financial needs. Regularly review your Emergency Fund to ensure it aligns with your current situation. Replenish any withdrawals promptly to maintain the desired level of financial security.", "In conclusion, an Emergency Fund is not a luxury but a necessity in today's unpredictable world. It is a foundational pillar of financial resilience, empowering individuals to navigate life's uncertainties with confidence and peace of mind. When the stock market is climbing, it can be tempting to abandon your emergency reserves for the allure of higher returns, but please dont jeopardize your short-term financial margin of safety the Emergency Fund."],

    "content": ["Innovation has always been an engine of success for companies. However, coming up with novel ideas can be challenging. The process of ideation requires creativity, experimentation and out-of-the-box thinking. One way to stimulate innovation is to combine two seemingly unrelated fields: scientific research and the arts; both fields have frequently been regarded as opposites, emphasizing empirical evidence and highlighting creative expression. However, different studies recognize the two fields' similarities. Both require curiosity, experimentation and a willingness to take risks. People often view scientific research and art as separate fields with different objectives and outcomes. However, when we bring them together, they can lead to new business ideas that are both innovative and profitable. For instance, science can provide new technologies and materials, while art can inspire new thinking methods and creative solutions to problems.", "Historically there are different examples of how science was influencing art refers to the idea that scientists can use scientific concepts and principles to create and inform artistic works. One famous example is Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa, where he used the golden mean, a mathematical ratio often associated with aesthetic beauty. The golden standard, also known as the divine proportion, is a ratio of approximately 1.618 to 1. This example shows how by using mathematical principles and scientific concepts, artists can create aesthetically pleasing works imbued with meaning and symbolism.", "When scientists and artists work together, they can bring different perspectives and skill sets, leading to a more comprehensive and innovative approach. For example, scientists might work with artists to develop new ways to visualize scientific data, or artists might collaborate with engineers to design new products. They also can collaborate by using art as a tool for communication. Many scientific concepts can be complex for the general public to understand, but scientists can use art to convey complex ideas in a more accessible way. This concept may result in a better understanding of scientific research, inspiring new business ideas.", "This kind of collaboration has already led to some groundbreaking innovations. For example, bio art combines biology with art to create living sculptures and installations, which has led to new ways of thinking about biological research and inspired new business ideas, such as developing bioluminescent materials for the fashion industry.", "Also, the field of science fiction has long been a source of inspiration for technological innovation. Many technologies we take for granted today, such as smartphones and video conferencing, were first imagined in science fiction novels and movies. By using the arts to imagine the future, we can inspire new business ideas that push the boundaries of what is possible.", "The basic idea of the complementary concept between art and science is that these two fields can work together harmoniously to produce something new and innovative. In other words, rather than being mutually exclusive, innovators can combine art and science can be connected to create something that is both beautiful and functional.", "By combining scientific data with artistic visualization techniques, we can create compelling and informative visualizations that can help to communicate complex ideas to a broader audience. Visualizations can be particularly valuable for sharing complex medical concepts with patients and their families in the medical field. Medical illustrators use their artistic skills to create accurate and detailed images of biological structures, such as organs and tissues, to aid medical education and research."],

While you may have the final judgment call, enlisting others to work through challenging decisions can be helpful. Asking for peers input can open your mind to new perspectives. For instance, if you ask your direct reports to brainstorm ways to improve your production process efficiency, chances are that they all have some ideas you didnt think of.

It does not matter whether your goal is weight loss, exercise, normal blood sugar, or decreasing stress ‚Äî research has shown that simply learning about the value of lifestyle changes is insufficient on its own to help people maintain their goals.", "Of course, few people are actually ignorant about the number of calories in a chocolate truffle, the benefits of exercise, or the incredible danger, discomfort, and inconvenience of diabetes and stress. Still, despite this awareness, maintaining these changes is an uphill battle. And thats largely because habits are hard to kick.The rewards of the changes themselves have their limits. On a cold, snowy day in February, going to the gym is far less appealing than staying in bed for one more hour. And when you return home tired from a day of work, the calories in that extra glass of wine may in fact suddenly turn invisible. So how can you get that extra motivation?", "The two types of rewards ‚Äî and what they can do for you Despite a growing body of evidence on the value of reward-based systems in promoting health behaviors, they are notoriously ineffective.

Hedonia (H-rewards) includes superficial pleasures such as weight loss, looking good, and acceptance by others. These rewards are more concrete and often short-lived. Eudaimonia (E-rewards), on the other hand, refers to a sense of meaning and purpose that contributes to overall well-being. Connecting your lifestyle goals to E-rewards may help motivate you even more.", "The greater the size of a self-processing region in your brain called the insula, the higher your E-rewards. Specifically, if you have a large insula, your senses of personal growth, positive relations with others, and personal purpose are high. Its not hard to imagine how feeling this way can help motivate you in many different ways, let alone when it comes to making specific lifestyle changes.", "E-rewards also motivate you by activating the brains reward region, the ventral striatum. You feel less depressed when this part of the brain is activated. In contrast, when you satisfy only your H-rewards (e.g., looking good and getting a massage), this can actually make you more depressed and less motivated in the longer term.", "To stay motivated, ask yourself how you will enhance your sense of meaning and purpose. They can be strong motivators for achieving your goals. The following are all examples of people with strong E-rewards motivating their decisions:", "A college sophomore obsessed with pizza and beer starts to eat and drink healthily when she realizes that her career in broadcast journalism will probably require her to be on camera day in and day out, so she needs to look (and feel) her best. A grandfather wont let anything stop him from going to the gym so that he can have the longest possible time alive to be with his grandchildren. A doting husband ignores most of the buffet table at a cocktail party (except for the veggies and dip) because he knows that he wants to be there for his wife and kids. A young woman decides to start skipping dessert when she recognizes that her work on eliminating poverty is too important for her to undermine her own well-being in any way.", "Its not just the service or job that inspires E-rewards either. The story is a little more complex.The concept of E-rewards can be traced back to Aristotle, who believed that the highest level of human good was not about satisfying ones appetites, but about striving to express the best that is within us. This could only really be achieved by self-realization, a continuous process that looks different for each person, depending on his or her unique talents and dispositions. As Aristotle points out, the first and foremost ultimate goal of all living humans is this feeling of well-being, which must be the primary focus if we are to achieve any of our health-related goals. Contrary to other theorists on the subject, Aristotle points out that H-rewards ‚Äî good friends, wealth, and power ‚Äî help as well. Yet, there is more to it than that. To truly feel E-rewards, you need to feel like you are flourishing in your life. In this inspired state, you are more likely to be motivated to achieve your goals.", "To start this process, ask yourself how much of your day you spend in activities that nurture this sense of self. According to Carol Ryff, there are six areas of your life that you can reshape to enhance these E-rewards: greater self-acceptance, higher-quality relationships, being in charge of your life, owning your own opinions even when others oppose them, personal growth, and having a strong intrinsic sense of purpose. If you work on these factors, you will likely feel more intrinsic reward, and therefore enhance your motivation to accomplish your lifestyle changes as well."],

Show your child that it is possible to express their feelings, listen to others, and work through any conflicts they encounter. When they see you responding to challenging situations with patience and understanding, they will be more likely to do the same. Additionally, take time to talk with your child about their feelings and help them to express themselves in a healthy manner. When you take the time to understand and empathise with your child, it will go a long way in helping them to develop their own emotional intelligence.", "A crucial part of helping your child develop emotional intelligence is teaching them to understand and control their emotions.

To me, loving myself means prioritizing myself, forgiving myself, and being content with who I am. Loving others is a complex feeling of affection and care for a person. I show my love directly: through physical closeness, offering my support, and reminding people that I love them. But many people do not show their love in these same ways.

For example, when I listen and give advice tHowever, as connected as receiving love and self-love are, it is important to retain some separation as well. It is dangerous when you depend on love from others to feel loved. Once, I loved someone so much that their love helped me to love myself. But when I lost that person, I lost my self-love. I blamed myself for the loss and assumed that I had done something wrong. I decided that I had never been good enough for the person. No matter the relationship, we should strive to love ourselves in isolation from those we love; people will always come and go, and if we ca not grow without them, we will never grow.o someone I love, I am reminded of my empathy and kindness.

However, sustaining motivation can be a complex and demanding task, particularly in the face of obstacles, monotony, and the ebb and flow of life's challenges. In this extensive exploration, we will delve into the intricacies of motivation and offer an in-depth guide on how to maintain a consistent wellspring of inspiration in your life.", "Before we can explore strategies for maintaining motivation, it is imperative to grasp the multifaceted nature of motivation itself. Motivation is not a one-size-fits-all concept but a complex interplay of psychological, emotional, and environmental factors. To gain mastery over this dynamic force, we must delve into these nuances.", "Motivation can take two primary forms, intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is the inner fire that is fueled by personal satisfaction, passion, and a deep sense of purpose. It emanates from within and is sustained by the joy of the pursuit itself. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is influenced by external rewards like money, fame, or praise. While both forms of motivation have their place, intrinsic motivation tends to be more sustainable and fulfilling in the long run.", "Understanding the Motivation Cycle is crucial to effective motivation management. This cycle consists of three phases: initiation, persistence, and completion. Recognizing these phases can provide valuable insights into maintaining motivation.", "In the initiation phase, motivation is often at its peak. This is when the excitement and anticipation of a new goal or project are at their highest. However, this initial surge of motivation is often short-lived, making it essential to transition into the persistence phase.", "The persistence phase is where the real work happens. Motivation can fluctuate during this phase, but this is when consistent effort and determination are required to achieve your goals. Many individuals experience a dip in motivation during this stage, which can be discouraging.", "Finally, the completion phase is the culmination of your efforts. When you successfully reach your goal, motivation often surges once again. It's a rewarding and satisfying phase, but it's important to have a plan for what comes next to prevent a motivation drop-off.", "Setting SMART Goals: The SMART framework provides a structured approach to goal setting, ensuring that your objectives are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This clarity enables easy tracking and evaluation, which is essential for maintaining motivation.", "Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals: To maintain consistent inspiration, distinguish between long-term aspirations and short-term milestones. Long-term goals provide direction and overarching purpose, while short-term goals serve as manageable steps that propel you towards your grander objectives. Long-term goals offer a sense of purpose and direction. They define the broader vision and help you understand the bigger picture of your life. These could be career aspirations, personal growth objectives, or life-changing ambitions.", "Short-term goals, on the other hand, provide actionable steps toward the achievement of your long-term goals. These are the milestones you need to reach to make progress. They give you a sense of accomplishment and provide motivation along the way. Short-term goals can vary in duration, from daily tasks to monthly objectives. For example, if your long-term goal is to become a published author, a short-term goal might be to write 1,000 words a day or complete a chapter each week."],
